# GenArtCanvas

Collaborative generative art canvas app built with Flutter & Firebase. It was built for a talk titled "[Real-time Animated Generative Art with Flutter & Firebase](https://f3.events/speakers/2f098344-5408-4cb7-8a70-ac2f0058d21f/)" given at the [Flutter Firebase Festival 2023](https://f3.events/)

## Inside The App
Initially, the app loads with animated cuboids shapes in grayscale colors

After enough entries through a simple UI in the app that allows you to add your own cuboids to the canvas, the canvas can look like this:
(these are the cuboids entered by the audience in the the Flutter Firebase Festival talk)
